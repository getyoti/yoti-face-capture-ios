# ChangeLog

## Version 5.1.2

Adds support for Swift Package Manager.

## Version 5.1.1

Fixes [#20](https://github.com/getyoti/yoti-face-capture-ios/issues/20).

## Version 5.1.0

Enabled landscape modes.

## Version 5.0.1

Reduced minimum platform version requirement of CocoaPods spec from iOS 13.0 to 11.0.

## Version 5.0.0

Replaced the `scanningArea` configuration parameter with `faceCenter`. The new parameter is the normalised point, in relation to the view provided by the SDK, where the user should centre their face.
This removes ambiguity and prevents situations where an area bigger than the scanned image could be provided.

Improvements and fixes.

## Version 4.1.1

Disabled serialisation of the debugging options.

## Version 4.1.0

Introduced a new validation option called `environmentTooDark` that can be set as part of the `Configuration` object. This new validation option is activated by default, meaning that the SDK will require a bright environment to return a valid frame containing a face. In order to migrate from previous versions, it is needed to include any required validation option except the `environmentTooDark` option when creating the `Configuration` object.
If the environment where the face is being captured is not meeting the brightness threshold value, the SDK will return a new error called `environmentTooDark`.
Please, check [README.md](https://github.com/getyoti/yoti-face-capture-ios/blob/main/README.md) for more details.
